#normal distribution
#The normal distribution is a form presenting data by arranging the probability distribution of each value in the data.Most values remain around the mean value making the arrangement symmetric.
#We use various functions in numpy library to mathematically calculate the values for a normal distribution. Histograms are created over which we plot the probability distribution curve.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
#ND is defined by mean, stddev
#mu, sigma = 0.5, 0.1
mu, sigma = 65, 10
s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)
s
# Create the bins and histogram
count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 8, normed=False)
bins
count
plt.bar(height=list(count), x=list(bins))
# Plot the distribution curve
plt.plot(bins, 1/(sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *   np.exp( - (bins - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2) ), linewidth=3, color='y')
plt.show();
